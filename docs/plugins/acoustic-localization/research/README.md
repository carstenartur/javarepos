# Acoustic localization — research notes

This folder collects the research-oriented documentation for the `audio-experimental-acoustic`
subproject. It complements the user-facing plugin documentation in
[`../README.md`](../README.md) and the runtime tracking architecture described in
[`../tracking.md`](../tracking.md).

The content here is intentionally narrower than a real paper: it is a working outline
that maps research concepts (TDOA, Doppler fusion, frequency tracking) onto the
classes, simulation scenarios and tests that already live in the repository, so the
documentation stays grounded in code that compiles and is exercised by tests.

## Conventions

- Every research claim must point at a class, scenario or test in the
  `audio-experimental-acoustic` module. If the code is not there yet, the document
  must explicitly mark the item as *future work*.
- Numerical constants (frequencies, positions, velocities) follow
  `SimulationScenarios` so that the documentation and the deterministic tests cannot
  drift apart silently.
- Ground-truth datasets live under [`simulation-datasets/`](simulation-datasets/) as
  JSON so that external benchmark scripts can consume them without depending on the
  Java code.

## Explicit non-goals

The work documented in this folder focuses on **localization, tracking,
prediction, synchronization, low-cost sensing and experimental DSP systems**.
It explicitly does **not** aim to:

- affect biological behaviour;
- manipulate animals, insects or any other living subject;
- create acoustic weapons or any device intended to harm;
- provide pest-control systems or repellents.

If a future contribution wants to apply this codebase to one of those domains,
that contribution belongs in a separate project with its own ethical review;
the acoustic subproject here remains a generic measurement and tracking
platform.
