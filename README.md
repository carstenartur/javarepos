**Audio Analyzer** is a Java 21 / Swing **audio and DSP laboratory**. It is useful for
repeatable signal demos, audio-analysis experiments, UI visualization and plugin research. It is
**not** a finished production platform for mosquito tracking.

The root Maven parent is `audioin-parent`; the runnable desktop application is `audio-app`.

## Project status

Stable infrastructure today:

- immutable `AudioBlock` / format models, SPSC ring buffer and deterministic signal generators;
- sample decoding, DSP pipelines, FFT spectrum, RMS/peak measurement, spectrogram and diagnosis
  analyzers;
- Swing dashboard panels for waveform, phase, spectrum, spectrogram, measurements and diagnosis;
- recording/replay, evidence export and Markdown A/B comparison tooling;
- Maven module-boundary tests, unit tests, Spotless, JaCoCo reports/check, Checkstyle/PMD/SpotBugs
  reports and CI baseline checks.

Experimental / research-oriented:

- acoustic-localization plugin code for wingbeat/frequency tracking, TDOA/GCC-PHAT, beamforming,
  Doppler experiments and simulations;
- plugin UI contributions and localization workflows. These are explicitly not validated as a
  production mosquito detector.

## Quickstart

Requires **Java 21** or higher. The Maven Wrapper is included.

```bash
# Build, test, run configured quality checks and produce reports
./mvnw clean verify

# Run the Swing app after package/verify
java -jar audio-app/target/audio-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

# Regenerate README + feature screenshots headlessly
java -cp "audio-app/target/audio-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:audio-app/target/lib/*" \
  org.hammer.tools.DocImageRenderer docs/images

# Optional JMH benchmarks
./mvnw -pl audio-dsp -Pjmh package
```

On Windows use `mvnw.cmd` instead of `./mvnw`; adapt the classpath separator from `:` to `;` for
manual `java -cp` commands.

## Feature groups

### Core audio / DSP platform

- layered capture → ring buffer → DSP → analysis → snapshot flow;
- immutable audio-domain types and UI-independent analysis snapshots;
- deterministic sine/square/chirp/demo generators for tests and demos;
- FFT spectrum, RMS/peak measurement, stereo delay, spectrogram and diagnosis analyzers;
- JMH benchmarks for selected hot paths.

### Swing dashboard

- live/demo input selection, waveform, phase, spectrum, spectrogram, measurements and diagnosis;
- pause/freeze, oscilloscope-style trigger, peak hold and spectrum averaging;
- JavaSound microphone input plus deterministic demo mode.

### Recording / export / comparison

- `.aar` recording and replay through the normal analysis pipeline;
- CSV/PNG and evidence-bundle export;
- Markdown A/B comparison reports for two recordings.

### Plugin / experimental acoustic localization

- `audio-plugin-api` contracts discovered by the app host via Java `ServiceLoader`;
- optional `audio-experimental-acoustic` runtime plugin for research workflows;
- details and limits: [Experimental Acoustic Localization](docs/plugins/acoustic-localization.md).

### Quality / tooling

- Maven multi-module build with Java 21 enforcement;
- Spotless formatting, unit tests and architecture-boundary tests;
- JaCoCo report plus a low 5% bundle line-coverage check;
- Checkstyle, PMD and SpotBugs reports; CI fails when report counts exceed the committed baseline;
- CodeQL workflow with an explicit Maven build.

## Maven modules

```text
audio-core
audio-geometry
audio-acquisition           -> audio-core, audio-geometry
audio-dsp                   -> audio-core
audio-plugin-api            (stable plugin contracts; no audio-* dependencies)
audio-experimental-acoustic -> audio-core, audio-geometry, audio-acquisition,
                               audio-dsp, audio-plugin-api
audio-app                   -> audio-core, audio-dsp, audio-plugin-api
                               runtime: audio-experimental-acoustic plugin
```

- `audio-core` — immutable audio-domain types, snapshots and ring buffer.
- `audio-geometry` — reusable 2D geometry and localization constraints.
- `audio-acquisition` — microphone metadata, arrays, multichannel sources and sample clocks.
- `audio-dsp` — FFT, DSP pipeline, analyzers, diagnostics, spectrogram and stereo-delay logic.
- `audio-plugin-api` — plugin contracts only.
- `audio-experimental-acoustic` — isolated acoustic-localization research plugin.
- `audio-app` — Swing UI, JavaSound/demo wiring, export, plugin host and entry point.
