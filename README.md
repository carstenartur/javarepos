**Audio Analyzer** is a modular real-time audio processing platform built around a Java/Swing
demo. It provides a layered architecture for audio acquisition, ring-buffering, DSP, analysis
(RMS/peak, FFT spectrum) and visualization, with deterministic synthetic signal generators and
JMH benchmarks. The bundled Swing UI renders a live waveform and phase diagram of the system
audio input.

> The Maven artifact is named `audioin` for historical reasons; the application is **Audio Analyzer**.

## Features

- **Layered architecture** — capture → ring buffer → DSP pipeline → analysis → snapshots → UI.
  See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **Immutable audio domain** — `AudioBlock` and `AudioFormatDescriptor` carry normalized
  `float[channels][frames]` samples, frame indices and timestamps; no UI types.
- **Lock-free SPSC ring buffer** for realtime workloads, with `offer` and `offerOverwrite`.
- **DSP extension points** — implement `DSPProcessor` and chain stages with `DSPPipeline`.
- **Analysis modules** — `RmsPeakAnalyzer`, `SpectrumAnalyzer` (pure-Java radix-2 FFT) producing
  immutable snapshots suitable for any UI or remote API.
- **Deterministic synthetic signals** — `SineGenerator`, `SquareGenerator`, `ChirpGenerator` for
  tests, headless demos and DSP verification.
- **Live Swing UI** — selectable microphone input, waveform, phase diagram, FFT spectrum,
  pause/freeze, peak-frequency readout, and CSV/PNG export for quick acoustic diagnostics.
- **Headless-friendly tests** — 81 unit tests covering immutability, FFT correctness, SPSC
  concurrency stress, signal determinism, DSP pipeline composition and sample decoding.
- **JMH benchmarks** for ring buffer throughput, FFT throughput and signal-generator
  allocations.
- **Java 21**, no heavyweight frameworks.

## Quickstart

Requires **Java 21** or higher.

```bash
# Build, test, run static analysis and coverage
./mvnw clean verify

# Run the application
java -jar target/audioin-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

# Run JMH benchmarks
./mvnw -Pjmh package
java -jar target/audioin-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  # see exec-maven-plugin config
```

On Windows use `mvnw.cmd` instead of `./mvnw`.

## MVP workflow

1. Select an audio input device from the **audio device** dropdown, or keep the system default.
2. Use **File → Start/Stop** to begin live capture.
3. Inspect the waveform and FFT spectrum; the dominant peak is shown as **peak frequency**.
4. Use **File → Pause/Freeze** to hold the current measurement.
5. Export the frozen or current measurement with **File → Export measurement CSV...** or
   **File → Export measurement PNG...**.
